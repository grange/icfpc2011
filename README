All code written in Python so the ``run'' file is the source file. Other
files are:

	comb.py - does card combinations
	eval.py - evaluates slot fields
	game.py - some general routines
	target_finder.py - code to find next slot to attack

The strategy is following:

	- try to attack fast at the very beginning the most ``important''
	slot of the opponent; importance is calculated from the
	number of applications in slot's field
	- zombify it to destroy any prepared combination; zombie function
	then attacks opponent's slot 0
	- build general attack and help spells
	- find the next ``important'' slot and attack in a loop;
	first attack slot which number is more easy to build
	- periodically check if our slots are alive, otherwise revive
	them
